To do this use the *Endpoint Mapping* endpoints.\n\n2) If the *host* field in the Swagger file is set to \"obp_mock\", the Dynamic Endpoints created will return *example responses defined in the swagger file*.\n\n3) If you need to link the responses to external resource, use the *Method Routing* endpoints.\n\n\nDynamic Endpoints can be created at the System level (bank_id is null) or Bank / Space level (bank_id is NOT null).\nYou might want to create Bank level Dynamic Entities in order to grant automated roles based on user email domain. See the OBP-API sample.props.template\n\nUpon the successful creation of each Dynamic Endpoint, OBP will automatically:\n\n*Create a Guard with a named Role on the Endpoint to protect it from unauthorised users.\n*Grant you an Entitlement to the required Role so you can call the endpoint and pass its Guard.\n\nThe following videos are available:\n\n\t* [Introduction to Dynamic Endpoints](https://vimeo.com/426235612)\n\t* [Features of Dynamic Endpoints](https://vimeo.com/444133309)\n\n"}]}

Clients can be web applications, native mobile and desktop applications, etc.\n#### Relying Party (RP)\nRP stands for Relying Party, an application or website that outsources its\nuser authentication function to an IDP.\n#### OpenID Provider (OP) or Identity Provider (IDP)\nAn OpenID Provider (OP) is an entity that has implemented the OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 protocols,\nOP\u2019s can sometimes be referred to by the role it plays, such as: a security token service,\nan identity provider (IDP), or an authorization server.\n#### Identity Token\nAn identity token represents the outcome of an authentication process.\nIt contains at a bare minimum an identifier for the user (called the sub aka subject claim)\nand information about how and when the user authenticated. It can contain additional identity data.\n#### User\nA user is a person that is using a registered client to access resources.\n    "}]}

It works by delegating user authentication to the service that hosts the user account, and authorizing third-party applications to access the user account. OAuth 2 provides authorization flows for web and desktop applications, and mobile devices.\n\n### OAuth2 Roles\n\nThe following is a general introduction to a so called \"3 legged OAuth2\" flow:\n\n* Resource Owner\n* Client\n* Resource Server\n* Authorization Server\n\n### Resource Owner: User\n\nThe resource owner is the user who authorizes an application to access their account. The application's access to the user's account is limited to the \"scope\" of the authorization granted (e.g. openid).\n\n### Authorization Server: API\n\nThe authorization server verifies the identity of the user then issues access tokens to the application. E.g. Hydra\n\n### Resource Server: API\n\nThe resource server hosts the protected user resources. E.g. OBP-API\n\n### Client: Application\n\nThe client is the application that wants to access the user's resource. In order to do that, it must be authorized by the user, and the authorization must be validated by the Authorization Server: API.\n\n### Authorization Grant\n\nOAuth 2 defines four grant types, each of which is useful in different cases:\n\n* Authorization Code: used with server-side Applications\n\n* Implicit: used with Mobile Apps or Web Applications (applications that run on the user's device)\n\n* Resource Owner Password Credentials: used with trusted Applications, such as those owned by the service itself\n\n* Client Credentials: used with Applications API access\n\n### Step 1: Get your App key\n\n[Sign up](https://test.openbankproject.com/user_mgt/sign_up) or [login](https://test.openbankproject.com/user_mgt/login) as a developer\n\nRegister your App key [HERE](https://test.openbankproject.com/consumer-registration)\n\nCopy and paste the CLIENT ID (AKA CONSUMER KEY), CLIENT SECRET (AKA CONSUMER SECRET) and REDIRECT_URL for the subsequent steps below.\n\n\n### Step 2: Initiate the OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect Flow\n\nOnce you have registered your App you should initiate the OAuth2 / OIDC flow using the following URL\n\nhttps://test-oauth2.openbankproject.com/hydra-public/oauth2/auth\n\nWITH THE following parameters:\n\nhttps://test-oauth2.openbankproject.com/hydra-public/oauth2/auth?client_id=YOUR-CLIENT-ID&response_type=code&state=GENERATED_BY_YOUR_APP&scope=openid+offline+ReadAccountsBasic+ReadAccountsDetail+ReadBalances+ReadTransactionsBasic+ReadTransactionsDebits+ReadTransactionsDetail&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2FYOUR-APP.com%2Fmain.html\n\n### Step 3: Exchange the authorisation code for an access token\n\nThe token endpoint is:\n\nhttps://test-oauth2.openbankproject.com/hydra-public/oauth2/token\n\n\nFor further information please see [here](https://www.ory.sh/hydra/docs/concepts/login#initiating-the-oauth-20--openid-connect-flow)\n\nIn this sandbox, this will cause the following flow:\n\n1) The User is authorised using OAuth2 / OpenID Connect against the banks authentication system\n2) The User grants consent to the App on the bank's Consent page.\n3) The User grants access to one or more accounts that they own on the bank's Account Selection page\n4) The User is redirected back to the App where they can now see the Accounts they have selected.\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://static.openbankproject.com/images/OBP-OAuth2-flow.png\" width=\"885\"></img>\n\n\n\nAn example Consent Testing App (Hola) using this flow can be found [here](https://github.com/OpenBankProject/OBP-Hola)\n\n\n\n\t\t\t"}]}

However, an Endpoint is a specific URL defined by its path (eg. /obp/v4.0/root) and its http verb (e.g. GET, POST, PUT, DELETE etc).\nEndpoints are like arrows into a system. Like any good computer function, endpoints should expect much and offer little in return. They should fail early and be clear about any reason for failure. In other words each endpoint should have a tight and limited contract with any caller - and especially the outside world!\n\nIn OBP, all system endpoints are RESTful - and most Open Banking Standards are RESTful. However, it is possible to create non-RESTful APIs in OBP using the Create Endpoint endpoints.\n\nYou can immediately tell if an endpoint is not RESTful by seeing a verb in the URL. For example:\n\nPOST /customers is RESTful = GOOD\nPOST /create-customer is NOT RESTful (due to the word \"create\") = BAD\n\nRESTful APIs use resource names in URL paths. You can think of RESTful resources like database tables. You wouldn't name a database table \"create-customer\", so don't use that in a URL path.\n\nIf we consider interacting with a Customers table, we read the data using GET /Customers and write to the table using POST /Customers. This model keeps the names clear and predictable.\nNote that we are only talking about the front end interface here - anything could be happening in the backend - and that is one of the beauties of APIs. For instance GET /Customers could call 5 different databases and 3 XML services in the background. Similarly POST /Customers could insert into various different tables and backend services. The important thing is that the user of the API (The Consumer or Client in OAuth parlance) has a simple and consistent experience.\n\nIn OBP, all Endpoints are implemented by `Partial Functions`. A Partial Function is a function which only accepts (and responds) to calls with certain parameter values. In the case of API Endpoints the inputs to the Partial Functions are the URL path and http verb. Note that it would be possible to have different Partial Functions respond even to different query parameters, but for OBP static endpoints at least, we take the approach of URL path + http Verb is handled by one Partial Function.\nEach Partial Function is identified by an Operation ID which uniquely identifies the endpoint in the system.

<p><em>Consent</em>, or <em>Account onboarding</em>, is the process by which the account owner gives permission for their account(s) to be accessible to the API endpoints.</p>\n<p>In OBP, the account, transaction and payment APIs are all guarded by Account <em>Views</em> - with one exception, the account holders endpoint which can be used to<br />\nbootstrap account on-boarding.</p>\n<p>Note: the account holders endpoint is generally made available only to the Account Onboarding App, so if a View does not exist, no API access to the account is possible.</p>\n<p><em>Consent</em> or <em>Account onboarding</em> can be managed in one of two ways:</p>\n<p>1) A backend system (CBS or other) is the system of record for User Consent, and OBP mirrors this.</p>\n<p>In this case:</p>\n<p>a) OBP requires the CBS or other backend system to return a list of accounts and permissions associated with a User.</p>\n<p>b) At User login, OBP automatically creates one or more Views for that User based on the permissions supplied by the CBS.</p>\n<p>2) OBP is the system of record for User Consent.</p>\n<p>In this case:</p>\n<p>a) OBP requires the CBS, Gateway or other system to provide just a basic list of accounts owned by the User.</p>\n<p>b) The Onboarding App or Bank's Onboarding Page then authenticates the User and calls the Create View endpoint.</p>\n<p>c) The account, transaction and payment API endpoints then work as moderated by the relevant View permissions.</p>\n<p>d) The User can revoke access by calling the delete View endpoint.</p>\n<p>In summary:</p>\n<p>Prior to Views being created on an Account for a User, only the 'accounts held' endpoint will work for the account holder, and this endpoint only provides enough information<br />\nto identify the account so it can be selected and on-boarded into the API.</p>\n<p>Once a View exists for an Account, a User can interact with the Account via the API based on permissions defined in the View.</p>\n\n</details>\n\n<br></br>\n\n<img width=\"468\" alt=\"OBP Access Control Image\" src=\"https://test.openbankproject.com/media/images/glossary/OBP_Consent_Request__3_.png\"></img>\n"}]}

This authentication mechanism is necessary so a third party application can consume the Open Bank project API securely.\n\nThe following documentation is based on the OAuth 1.0a specification so if you need more details you can refer to it.\n\nBefore starting to interact with the API, third party applications needs to get OAuth keys (consumer key and secret key). You can register your application here to get those keys for interacting with real data. If you want to use the sandbox before handling real data, please register your application here\n\n### 1) Obtain a request token\n\nTo start a sign in flow, the application must obtain a request token by sending a signed message to :\n\n    POST https://test.openbankproject.com/oauth/initiate\n\n* oauth_callback: an absolute URI back to which the server will redirect the resource owner (user) when Authorization step is completed. If the application is unable to receive callbacks the parameter value MUST be set to \u201coob\u201d (case sensitive), to indicate an out-of-band configuration.\n\n* oauth_consumer_key : The identifier portion of the client credentials (consumer key) which is obtained after application registration.\n\n* oauth_nonce : A nonce is a random string, uniquely generated by the client to allow the server to verify that a request has never been made before. The nonce value MUST be unique across all requests with the same timestamp, application credentials, and token combinations.\n\n* oauth_signature : the result of signing the request. Explained in detail here.\n\n* oauth_signature_method : The name of the signature method that will be used by the application to sign the request, as defined in OAuth protocol. The Open Bank Project OAuth server support \"SHA1\" and \"SHA256\" so the parameter MUST be set to \u201cHMAC-SHA1\" or \u201cHMAC-SHA256\u201d\n\n* oauth_timestamp : The timestamp value MUST be a positive integer and is expressed in the number of seconds since January 1, 1970 00:00:00 GMT.\n\n* oauth_version : OPTIONAL. If present, MUST be set to \"1.0\". Provides the version of the authentication process as defined in the OAuth 1.0 protocol specification.\n\nExample:\n\n    POST /oauth/initiate HTTP/1.1\n\n    Host: https://test.openbankproject.com\n\n    Authorization: OAuth\n\n    oauth_callback=\"http%3A%2F%2Fprinter.example.com%2Fready\",\n\n    oauth_consumer_key=\"cChZNFj6T5R0TigYB9yd1w\",\n\n    oauth_nonce=\"ea9ec8429b68d6b77cd5600adbbb0456\",\n\n    oauth_signature=\"F1Li3tvehgcraF8DMJ7OyxO4w9Y%3D\",\n\n    oauth_signature_method=\"HMAC-SHA256\",\n\n    oauth_timestamp=\"1318467427\",\n\n    oauth_version=\"1.0\"\n\nimportant: We will explain below in the \"signature\" section how to calculate the value of the \"oauth_signature\" field.\n\nNote : line breaks are for display purposes only, the application MUST send the parameters on one line and the only separator between the parameters is a coma \u201c,\u201d.\n\nThe server validates the request and replies with a set of temporary credentials in the body of the HTTP response.\n\nExample (line breaks are for display purposes only) :\n\n    HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n    oauth_token=hh5s93j4hdidpola&oauth_token_secret=hdhd0244k9j7ao03&oauth_callback_confirmed=true\n\nThe application should examine the HTTP status of the response. Any value other than 200 indicates a failure. The body of the response will contain the oauth_token, oauth_token_secret, and oauth_callback_confirmed parameters. The application should verify that oauth_callback_confirmed is true and store the other two values for the next steps.\n\n### 2) Redirect the user\n\nThe next step is to direct the user to Open Bank Project so that he may complete the authentication.\n\nDirect the user to :\n\n    GET oauth/authorize\n\nand the request token obtained in step 1 should be passed as the oauth_token parameter.\n\nThe most seamless way for a website to implement this would be to issue a HTTP 302 redirect as the response to the original request. Mobile and desktop applications should open a new browser window or direct to the URL via an embedded web view.\n\nExample :\n\n    https://test.openbankproject.com/oauth/authorize?oauth_token=NPcudxy0yU5T3tBzho7iCotZ3cnetKwcTIRlX0iwRl0\n\nUpon a successful authentication, the callback URL would receive a request containing the oauth_token and oauth_verifier parameters. The application should verify that the token matches the request token received in step 1.\n\nIf the callback URL was not specified (oob) than the verifier will be shown in the page and the user has to enter it into the application manually.\n\n### 3) Convert the request token to an access token\n\nTo convert the request token into a usable access token, the application must make a:\n\n    POST https://test.openbankproject.com/oauth/token\n\nrequest containing the oauth_verifier value obtained in step 2. The request token is also passed as oauth_token parameter of the header.\n\nNote : The oauth_callback_url parameter is not necessary any more.\n\nExample :\n\n    POST /oauth/token HTTP/1.1\n\n    Host: https://test.openbankproject.com\n\n    Authorization: OAuth\n\n    oauth_verifier=\"9312832\",\n\n    oauth_token=\u201daze2342352aze\u201d,\n\n    oauth_consumer_key=\"cChZNFj6T5R0TigYB9yd1w\",\n\n    oauth_nonce=\"ea9ec8429b68d6b77cd5600adbbb0456\",\n\n    oauth_signature=\"F1Li3tvehgcraF8DMJ7OyxO4w9Y%3D\",\n\n    oauth_signature_method=\"HMAC-SHA256\",\n\n    oauth_timestamp=\"1318467427\",\n\n    oauth_version=\"1.0\"\n\nLike the step 1, a successful response contains the oauth_token & oauth_token_secret and they should be stored and used for future authenticated requests to the OBP API.\n\nThe application can now use the access token to access protected resources.\n\n### 4) Access protected resources\n\nOnce the application has an a access token and secret token, it can access protected resources. The request is the same as in step 3 except the oauth_verifer which MUST not be included in the header.\n\nPlease see the API documentation for more details on how to access protected resources.\n\n### Recommended OAuth 1.0 libraries:\n\nIf you want to use a OAuth library to handle the OAuth process for your application, we have successfully tested these ones:\n\n* JAVA:\n\n [signpost](http://code.google.com/p/oauth-signpost/). Warning any version below 1.2.1.2 probably will not work. Version 1.2 which is the current Maven version seems to cause problems.\n\n* PHP:\n\n [OAuth Consumer And Server Library] (https://code.google.com/p/oauth-php/)\n\n* Scala:\n\n [Dispatch] (http://dispatch.databinder.net/Dispatch.html)\n\n* OBP SDKs / examples of client code with OAuth:\n\n [OBP SDKs](https://github.com/OpenBankProject/OBP-API/wiki/OAuth-Client-SDKS)\n\n### Examples :\n\nTo show the OAuth integration in concrete examples, please check out these projects listed here:\n[Hello-OBP-OAuth1.0a-LANGUAGE/PLATFORM](https://github.com/OpenBankProject)\n\n### Signature :\n\nAccording to the [section-3.4](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849#section-3.4) in the OAuth 1.0 protocol specification the signature computation is done following theses steps :\n\n\na) Signature Base String :\n\nThe signature base string is a consistent, reproducible concatenation of several of the HTTP request elements into a single string. The string is used as an input to the signature methods.\n\nThe signature base string includes the following components of the HTTP request:\n\n* The HTTP request method (e.g., \"GET\", \"POST\", etc.).\n\n* The authority as declared by the HTTP \"Host\" request header field.\n\n* The path and query components of the request resource URI.\n\n* he protocol parameters excluding the \"oauth_signature\".\n\nThe signature base string does not cover the entire HTTP request. Most notably, it does not include the entity-body in most requests, nor does it include most HTTP entity-headers.\n\nThe signature base string is constructed by concatenating together, in order, the following HTTP request elements:\n\n1. The HTTP request method in uppercase. For example: \"HEAD\", \"GET\", \"POST\", etc. If the request uses a custom HTTP method, it MUST be encoded (Section 3.6).\n\n2. An \"&\" character (ASCII code 38).\n\n3. The base string URI from Section 3.4.1.2, after being encoded (Section 3.6).\n\n4. An \"&\" character (ASCII code 38).\n\n5. The request parameters as normalized in Section 3.4.1.3.2, after being encoded (Section 3.6).\n\nExplained shortly below the example.\n\nExample:\n\n    POST /oauth/token HTTP/1.1\n    Host: https://test.openbankproject.com\n    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n    Authorization: OAuth\n    oauth_consumer_key=\"91919\",\n    oauth_token=\"OGESD9MrWQEGPXOyPjHCRrCw7BPelWJjnomibV6bePU\",\n    oauth_signature_method=\"HMAC-SHA256\",\n    oauth_timestamp=\"1340878170\",\n    oauth_nonce=\"DFXOQFZVK8K46KDR11\",\n    oauth_signature=\"bYT5CMsGcbgUdFHObYMEfcx6bsw%3D\"\n\nIs represented by the following signature base string (line breaks are for display purposes only):\n\n    POST&https%3A%2F%2Fhttps://test.openbankproject.com&oauth_consumer_key%3D91919%26oauth_nonce%3DDFXOQFZVK8K46KDR11%26oauth_signature_method%3Dhmac-sha256%26oauth_timestamp%3D1340878170%26oauth_token%3DOGESD9MrWQEGPXOyPjHCRrCw7BPelWJjnomibV6bePU%26oauth_verifier%3DT0dXUDBZR09LUVlGTU9NSlhIUUc%26oauth_version%3D1\n\nThe request parameters normalization :\n\n1. The name and value of each parameter are encoded Section 3.6.\n\n2. The parameters are sorted by name, using ascending byte value ordering.\n\n3. The name of each parameter is concatenated to its corresponding value using an \"=\" character (ASCII code 61) as a separator, even if the value is empty.\n\n4. The sorted name/value pairs are concatenated together into a single string by using an \"&\" character (ASCII code 38) as separator.\n\nB) Signing the request :\n\nThe Open Bank Project OAuth 1.0 implementation uses the \u201cHMAC-SHA1\u201d and \u201cHMAC-SHA256\u201d as signing methods. The key to sign the base string is the concatenation of the consumer secret and the token secret with the \u201c&\u201d character in the middle like this: oauth_consumer_secret&oauth_token_secret, in the first step the application does not have yet a token so it will be an empty string.\n\nThe signature that results from the signature process MUST be encoded in base 64 also since the protocol requires encoding all the OAuth parameters.\n\n### Illustration of integration with a bank back-end :\n\nThe following link shows how the integration of the OAuth process would be with a bank back-end: [https://github.com/OpenBankProject/OBP-API/wiki/OAuth-Integration-Illustration](https://github.com/OpenBankProject/OBP-API/wiki/OAuth-Integration-Illustration)\n\n\n\n\t\t\t"}]}

instance!*\n\nGateway Login Authorisation is made by including a specific header (see step 3 below) in any OBP REST call.\n\nNote: Gateway Login does *not* require an explicit POST like Direct Login to create the token.\n\nThe **Gateway is responsible** for creating a token which is trusted by OBP **absolutely**!\n\nWhen OBP recieves a token via Gateway Login, OBP creates or gets a user based on the username supplied.\n\n![obp login via gateway and jwt](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/485218/32783397-e39620ee-c94b-11e7-92e3-b244b8e841dd.png)\n\n\nTo use Gateway Login:\n\n### 1) Configure OBP API to accept Gateway Login.\n\nSet up properties in a props file\n\n```\n# -- Gateway login --------------------------------------\n# Enable/Disable Gateway communication at all\n# In case isn't defined default value is false\n# allow_gateway_login=false\n# Define comma separated list of allowed IP addresses\n# gateway.host=127.0.0.1\n# Define secret used to validate JWT token\n# jwt.token_secret=your-at-least-256-bit-secret-token\n# -------------------------------------- Gateway login --\n```\nPlease keep in mind that property jwt.token_secret is used to validate JWT token to check it is not changed or corrupted during transport.\n\n### 2) Create / have access to a JWT\n\n\n\nHEADER:ALGORITHM & TOKEN TYPE\n\n```\n{\n  \"alg\": \"HS256\",\n  \"typ\":

For instance the balance on an account may be hidden from the public.

(so OBP nodes only listen only to the correct Topics).\n\nThe dependent endpoints are listed to facilitate navigation in the API Explorer so integrators can test endpoints during integration.\n\nMessage Docs can be generated automatically using OBP code tools. Thus, it's possible to create custom connectors that follow specific protocol and structural patterns e.g. for message queue X over XML format Y.\n\n"}]}

However, an Endpoint is a specific URL defined by its path (eg. /obp/v4.0/root) and its http verb (e.g. GET, POST, PUT, DELETE etc).\nEndpoints are like arrows into a system. Like any good computer function, endpoints should expect much and offer little in return. They should fail early and be clear about any reason for failure. In other words each endpoint should have a tight and limited contract with any caller - and especially the outside world!\n\nIn OBP, all system endpoints are RESTful - and most Open Banking Standards are RESTful. However, it is possible to create non-RESTful APIs in OBP using the Create Endpoint endpoints.\n\nYou can immediately tell if an endpoint is not RESTful by seeing a verb in the URL. For example:\n\nPOST /customers is RESTful = GOOD\nPOST /create-customer is NOT RESTful (due to the word \"create\") = BAD\n\nRESTful APIs use resource names in URL paths. You can think of RESTful resources like database tables. You wouldn't name a database table \"create-customer\", so don't use that in a URL path.\n\nIf we consider interacting with a Customers table, we read the data using GET /Customers and write to the table using POST /Customers. This model keeps the names clear and predictable.\nNote that we are only talking about the front end interface here - anything could be happening in the backend - and that is one of the beauties of APIs. For instance GET /Customers could call 5 different databases and 3 XML services in the background. Similarly POST /Customers could insert into various different tables and backend services. The important thing is that the user of the API (The Consumer or Client in OAuth parlance) has a simple and consistent experience.\n\nIn OBP, all Endpoints are implemented by `Partial Functions`. A Partial Function is a function which only accepts (and responds) to calls with certain parameter values. In the case of API Endpoints the inputs to the Partial Functions are the URL path and http verb. Note that it would be possible to have different Partial Functions respond even to different query parameters, but for OBP static endpoints at least, we take the approach of URL path + http Verb is handled by one Partial Function.\nEach Partial Function is identified by an Operation ID which uniquely identifies the endpoint in the system. Having an Operation ID allows us to decorate the Endpoint with metadata (e.g. Tags) and surround the Endpoint with behaviour such as JSON Schema Validation.\n\nSee also [API](/glossary#API)\n\n"}]}

to create the token.\n\nThe **Gateway is responsible** for creating a token which is trusted by OBP **absolutely**!\n\nWhen OBP recieves a token via Gateway Login, OBP creates or gets a user based on

Each endpoint has a Resource Doc (a Scala case class) defined in the source code.\n\nThis endpoint is used by OBP API Explorer to display and work with the API documentation.\n\nMost (but not all) fields are also available in swagger format. (The Swagger endpoint is built from Resource Docs.)\n\nAPI\\_VERSION is the version you want documentation about e.g. v3.0.0\n\nYou may filter this endpoint with tags parameter e.g. ?tags=Account,Bank\n\nYou may filter this endpoint with functions parameter e.g. ?functions=enableDisableConsumers,getConnectorMetrics\n\nFor possible function values, see implemented\\_by.function in the JSON returned by this endpoint or the OBP source code or the footer of the API Explorer which produces a comma separated list of functions that reflect the server or filtering by API Explorer based on tags etc.\n\nYou may filter this endpoint using the 'content' url parameter, e.g. ?content=dynamic  \nif set content=dynamic, only show dynamic endpoints, if content=static, only show the static endpoints. if omit this parameter, we will show all the endpoints.\n\nYou may need some other language resource docs, now we support en\\_GB and es\\_ES at the moment.\n\nYou can filter with api-collection-id, but api-collection-id can not be used with others together. If api-collection-id is used in URL, it will ignore all other parameters.\n\nSee the Resource Doc endpoint for more information.\n\nNote: Dynamic Resource Docs are cached, TTL is 3600 seconds  \nStatic Resource Docs are cached, TTL is 3600 seconds\n\nFollowing are more examples:  \n<https://test.openbankproject.com/obp/v4.0.0/banks/BANK_ID/resource-docs/v4.0.0/obp>  \n<https://test.openbankproject.com/obp/v4.0.0/banks/BANK_ID/resource-docs/v4.0.0/obp?tags=Account,Bank>  \n<https://test.openbankproject.com/obp/v4.0.0/banks/BANK_ID/resource-docs/v4.0.0/obp?functions=getBanks,bankById>  \n<https://test.openbankproject.com/obp/v4.0.0/banks/BANK_ID/resource-docs/v4.0.0/obp?locale=es_ES>  \n<https://test.openbankproject.com/obp/v4.0.0/banks/BANK_ID/resource-docs/v4.0.0/obp?content=static,dynamic,all>  \n<https://test.openbankproject.com/obp/v4.0.0/banks/BANK_ID/resource-docs/v4.0.0/obp?api-collection-id=4e866c86-60c3-4268-a221-cb0bbf1ad221>\n\n* operation\\_id is concatenation of \"v\", version and function and should be unique (used for DOM element IDs etc. maybe used to link to source code)\n* version references the version that the API call is defined in.\n* function is the (scala) partial function that implements this endpoint. It is unique per version of the API.\n* request\\_url is empty for the root call, else the path.

In OBP, endpoints are first made available at the request\\_url, but the same resource (function call) is often made available under later versions (specified\\_url). To access the latest version of all endpoints use the latest version available on your OBP instance e.g. /obp/v3.1.0 - To get the original version use the request\\_url. We recommend to use the specified\\_url since non semantic improvements are more likely to be applied to later implementations of the call.\n* summary is a short description inline with the swagger terminology.\n* description may contain html markup (generated from markdown on the server).\n\nAuthentication is Mandatory\n\n"}]}

(so OBP nodes only listen only to the correct Topics).\n\nThe dependent endpoints are listed to facilitate navigation in the API Explorer so integrators can test endpoints during integration.\n\nMessage Docs can be generated automatically using OBP code tools. Thus, it's possible to create custom connectors that follow specific protocol and structural patterns e.g. for message queue X over XML format Y.\n\n"}]}
